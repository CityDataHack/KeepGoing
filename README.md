# Introduction

That's the repository of the team "Keep Going". The project is about Social Isolation in the Borough of Barking and Dagenham. We designer a mobile phone application, based on the React Native Framework and the React-Native-Tab-View library. The application gives incentives and has as a core the 'Tree of Progress'.
