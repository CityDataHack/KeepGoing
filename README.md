# Introduction

That's the repository of the team "Keep Going". The project is about Social Isolation in the Borough of Barking and Dagenham. We designer a mobile phone application, based on the Google's Flutter Native Framework based on Google's Web Components. The application gives incentives and has as a core the 'Tree of Progress'.

If you need to contact us or drop some commits and upgrade our project feel free to do so.
